# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a repo for The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors project. I aim to practice
more with vanilla JavaScript while completing this project, specifically with using
prompts, user inputs, functions, conditionals, and loops if needed.

After finishing this project, I practiced:

- Creating functions and assigning their return values to variables for later use
- Executing functions within a file
- Using while loops and the break keyword to account for invalid user inputs
- Using prompts to collect and save user input and alerts to display information
- Using switch statements within a function alongside Math.random (and floor)
